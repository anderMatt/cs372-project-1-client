# cs372-project-1-client

Execution
===

```bash
$ make clean
$ make
$ ./client <host> <port>
```

After connecting to the other part at host:port, you will be prompted to enter
a username handle. You may then initiate a chat by entering a text message and pressing 'enter' to send.

When your username handle does not appear in the console, the other host is writing a message and you must wait to receive it before sending another message.
